Introduction
============
`pypulseq <https://github.com/imr-framework/pypulseq>`_ enables vendor-neutral pulse sequence design in Python [1]_ [2]_. The pulse sequences can be exported as a `.seq` file to be run on  Siemens/`GE <https://toppemri.github.io>`_/`Bruker <https://github.com/pulseq/bruker_interpreter>`_ hardware by leveraging their respective Pulseq interpreters. This tool is targeted at MR pulse sequence designers, MRI researchers and other interested users. It is a translation of the Pulseq framework originally written in Matlab [3]_.

It is strongly recommended to first read the `Pulseq specification <https://pulseq.github.io/specification.pdf>`_ before proceeding. The specification document defines the concepts required for pulse sequence design using `pypulseq`.
